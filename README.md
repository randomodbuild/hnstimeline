# hnstimeline
A simple timeline bounty for the Handshake (HNS) project, specifically as it relates to namebase.io

This was actually my first ever HTML project (or coding project in general), hence it is quite rudimentary.

Somebody else who was much more experienced got to it first, but I still learned a lot! Also, <a href="johnnywu/">Johnnywu<a> was kind and still sent me 100 HNS!

For those who don't know, Handshake aims to decentralize the DNS root zone file and store it on a blockchain. I find the project really interesting, and hope more people adopt it. 
More info on Handshake can be found here: (https://learn.namebase.io/)

Also, the website you should use for the better timeline is here: (http://handshake.yearly/)
Note, you will need to set your DNS to resolve Handshake names to access it. I would use NextDNS, it is quite simple to setup!
